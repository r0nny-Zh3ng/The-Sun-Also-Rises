Deeply Nested Object Study

Chosen Object: The Sun


The Sun is the star at the center of the solar system. The Sun's radius is about 695,000 kilometers, or 109 times that of Earth. 

We are so familiar with the Sun as it appears above our heads every day regardless of the weather, it is always there. In this project, rather analyzing the Sun in a scientific language, I want to discuss the metaphoric meaning of the Sun. 

The Sun is the only one star. The Sun has been a worshipping object for a long period of time. It is the source of warmth and energy. In mythology across almost every culture, the Sun is represented in a holy sense. Our physicality and mentality are influenced by the Sun. 

How to apotheosize an object or a person? Giving it the meaning related to the Sun. 


"It is always above us."
"It can't hear our voices."
"It is a useful symbol that actually exist."
"It is the only one"

"We cannot look straight to the Sun."
